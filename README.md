# Photography
A guide to learning photography, this will eventually be turned into a YouTube series. In all the youtube stuff I've come across regarding photography, I felt that I've never come across a solid channel that walks someone from the very basics directly all the way to being an advanced photographer. 

Modeling this based off of the work of [CTRL PAINT](https://www.ctrlpaint.com/). 

# Steps

1. **Collecting information** and **map out** knowledge as I do so
2. Once I feel I have it sufficently mapped out and have **synthesized** all my **resources** for the Beginner series start to **write scripts**
3. Once scripts are finnished, film a test script or two. 
4. Do an evaluation on how effective you feel the video is? Did you use the research/stratgies from the Visual Teach Stratgey file. Is the information concise and what a beginner needs to know. Are you avoiding fluff? Are the visuals supporting the information you are trying to communicate? What could be better? Do you need to remake?
5. Repeat steps 3-4 until satisfaction
6. Repeat whole process for all the other series I would like to do. See the attached image of how I see it looking
7. see free code camp, random quote generator
